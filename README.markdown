#doh bits and bobs

Yeah, it's one of those places to dump code fragments that come in handy, but don't deserve a place of their own.

CONTENTS:
 
scripts:
 doing.py -- update status for http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/, from the command line, and log results into a text file
 logwatch.py -- monitor pidgin logs, display GUI notofications for messages matching some pattern. Would likely also work for any other logs

Most of these will probably need some tweaking before use; if you do find anything of use, consider it public domain, and feel free to use it however you like.
